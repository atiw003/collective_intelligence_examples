== Welcome to the collective intelligence examples

This application aims to build the examples from the Programming Collective Intelligence book from O'Reilly ( http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/ )
using the Ruby programming language in a Rails application. This codebase is a suplement to the book contents,
so be sure to also have it to be able to get a better view of what we we are doing here.
